HOW TO disable some settings of the "mrGameplay" by script in your mod

you can assign (by script) these variables in your mod (directly in the lua file, not included into a function) : 

g_currentMission.mrGameplayDoChangeFillTypes = false
g_currentMission.mrGameplayDoChangeFruitTypes = false
g_currentMission.mrGameplayDoChangeSprayTypes = false
g_currentMission.mrGameplayDoChangeFruitConvertersTypes = false

the "mrGameplay" check these variables just after the "Mission00.setMissionInfo" function is complete

HOW TO set specific gameplay values for your map

1. create a new folder named "mrgameplay" (lower case) at the root level of your map folder
2. open the "moreRealisticGameplay\data" folder => you can copy-paste any files from this location to the newly created "mrgameplay" folder
3. delete/add/modify what you want. The values from the "mrgameplay" folder of your map will override the ones from the "moreRealisticGameplay\data" folder
