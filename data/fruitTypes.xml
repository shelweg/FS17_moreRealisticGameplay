<!-- notes


Default yields set in the MR Gameplay are not unrealistic (they all come from IRL data). But represent one of the best yields you can achieve worldwide.
Providing there are no tracks in the field, no misses at seeding, no storm or weather problem, no insect problem, no wetness problem, no diseases, no weeds and no "collateral damage" when spraying neighboring crops.
In fact, MR Gameplay yields are clearly realistic based on the conditions we have in the game.

literPerSqm = how much liters per square meter you get for a given crop (when there is no fertilizer and no ploughing bonus)
max yield wanted in ton per Hectare = literPerSqm * 20 * density of the grain
literPerSqm = max yield wanted in ton per Hectare / 20 / density of the grain



forage wagon use "windrowLiterPerSqm" (and so, once the "windrow" is present in your savegame, even by changing this value, the quantity picked up by the forage wagon remains the same)
Forage harvester pickup header use "literPerSqm" (and so, even if the windrow is already present in your savegame, you can "change" the quantity picked up by modifying the "literPerSqm" value)
This is a "bug" => forage harbester and forage wagon get different liters from the same windrow
Fixed in "mr" V0.3.04 -> both only use the windrow liters capacity (do not rely anymore on the literPerSqm)
